Effortlessly sync your WordPress plugin data with your favorite platforms.

== DESCRIPTION ==

AFI is a simple tool that links your website forms to various other platforms. It can connect with email marketing, CRM, spreadsheets, task management, and different software. AFI ensures the information goes to these other programs when someone fills out a form. AFI isn't just for forms; it can also connect with other plugins like WooCommerce, LearnDash, GiveWP, etc.

* **Easy to use**: The plugin was created with not-tech people in mind. Setting up new integrations is a breeze and can be accomplished within minutes. No coding skill is required, almost no learning curve.

* **Flexible**: Integrations between sender and receiver platforms can be created. You can create as many connections as you wantâ€”single sender to multiple receivers, multiple senders to a single receiver, various senders to multiple receivers. Remember that all PHP server has a maximum execution time allowed.

* **Conditional Logic**: You can create single or multiple conditional logic to filter the data flow. Submitted data will only be sent if the conditions match. For example, when you want to send contact data only if the user has agreed and filed the checkbox "I agree" (Contact Form 7 acceptance field) or if the city is only New York or the subject contacts the word "Lead," etc. You can set up the conditions as you like.

* **Special Tags**: We have introduced several special tags that can be passed to receiver platforms. These are helpful when you want more system information, like IP address, user agent, etc. Example: `{{_date}},` `{{_time}}`, `{{_weekday}}`, `{{_user_ip}},` `{{_user_agent}},` `{{_site_title}},` `{{_site_description}},` `{{_site_url}},` `{{_site_admin_email}},` `{{_post_id}},` `{{_post_name}},` `{{_post_title}},` `{{_post_url}},` `{{_user_id}},` `{{_user_first_name}},` `{{_user_last_name}},` `{{_user_last_name}},` `{{_user_email}}.`

* **Job Queue**: Leverage the proven reliability of [Action Scheduler](https://actionscheduler.org) for seamless background processing of extensive task queues within WordPress. Activate this functionality in AFI settings to improve the submission process and ensure a smooth user experience.

* **Multisite**: Multisite supported.

* **Log**: A powerful log feature with an edit and resend function. If something goes wrong on a submission, the admin can go to the log, edit/correct the data, and resend it.
